This product is aimed at any woman who is worried about the appearance of ageing.\nHow it works:\n\nCell rejuvenating: The action activates the cell's vital functions by cellular multiplication, cellular growth and the cellular longevity. The concentrate of 20 amino acids, 14 vitamins, 15 biological agents and 7 mineral salts are essential to cellular life. This formula is known to rapidly regenerate the skin on people who have suffered burn injuries. FACT!\n\nTissue rejuvenating: This is where skin is recreated firmer and appears to look more youthful. The serum increases the amount of elastic fibres which encourages skin to appear smoother and firmer. Also, the production of collagen is stimulated thanks to the Ederline. The anti-glycation complex prevents elastic fibres from getting damaged.\n\nThe ingredients within this formula work together in order to achieve maximum results. Firstly, the main ingredient is the same active one used throughout the whole line - ‘Cellular life concentrate'. This is how you know that this serum is going to be just as good as the rest of the line. The anti-oxidants in this product protect the tissue within from free-radicals which can be very harmful to the skin. Stubborn wrinkles are reduced and the lack of firmness is diminished.\nHow to use:\n\nApply to the face and neck underneath your regular skincare cream. It is to be used as an intensive treatment, based on the skin's specific needs. Once the serum has penetrated the skin is left with a ‘soft film' over the cutaneous surface. Tone and suppleness is restored and the skin is left radiantly beautiful and has a more youthful appearance.",

  "B00LEWE6RG": "Introducing the #1 Vitamin C Serum on the market today. Scientific studies revealed a 57.9% improvement in skin quality with vitamin C . Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant proven to reverse the signs of aging, renew collagen, enhance elasticity of skin, and helps repair photo sun damage. We have succeeded in creating the world's most effective topical Vitamin C Serum 20%. J-Essentials Super Vitamin C + E + HA is superior to other C serums because it was manufactured using Triple C Technologies. Other Serums are unstable and virtually impossible to absorb the Vitamin C into skin at this percentage, allowing for minimal results. We have harnessed all it's inherent power to formulate a product that delivers massive anti-aging benefits. Other C Serums can oxidize very quickly and loose the ability to produce results over time. Our serum has a shelf life of 2 years. No other L-Ascorbic product is this stable and effective. The formula contains additional ingredients Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, and Aloe. Vitamin C vs. Free Radicals Vitamin antioxidants that can improve the appearance of fine lines on the skin include vitamin E and C, as well as the retinoids, which are derivatives of vitamin A. Antioxidants are thought to be beneficial due to their ability to reduce, neutralize, and prevent the damage done to the body by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable oxygen molecules that your body produces through metabolic processes, such as food absorption, and via ingestion of toxins from dietary sources, or exposure to air pollution. Basically, during the course of daily life, you are constantly subjected to potential sources that promote free radical production. It is thought that the multiple benefits of antioxidants include their ability to reduce free radical damage by blocking the oxidative processes in cells, inhibit inflammation that leads to collagen depletion, and offer protective assistance against sun damage and skin cancer.",

  "B00DHN8J7S": "This unique Acne Treatment Serum contains a high concentration of not less than 3% Isoflavones or Phytoestrogens, a hormone-like natural plant derived compound. It is recognized that androgenic hormones (male hormones) are the only hormones that stimulate the sebaceous glands to enlarge and produce sebum, which when produced in excess can lead to acne. Affecting the skin receptors, Isoflavones unlike any other ingredient on the market has the ability to block the effects of androgens on the sebaceous glands. Phospholipids â€“ a valuable and necessary substance with its ability to create cell membranes, maintain healthy integrity of cell membrane as well as improve the skin appearance by regenerating skin cell membranes. Saponins is a glycoside compound with its superb silky texture. When the plant tissue is damaged Saponins are produced rapidly. This molecule has the ability to absorb, rid the skin of a toxic buildup, which leads the skin cells to produce more energy and enhances the rejuvenating process. Scientific evidence indicates that Phytosterols work to increase immune capabilities and increase the skin's natural resistance to inflammations, which work to fight against negative environmental effects. This product is infused with Soy Doctorâ„¢ Complex, an exclusively created complex which includes Phospholipids, Phytosterols and Saponins working synergistically with Phytoestrogens (Isoflavones) and Salicylic Acid to superbly reduce sebaceous glands and decrease the amount of sebum that is secreted. This serum is enriched with Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe, Green Tea Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Ivy Extract, Comfrey Extract and Cherry Bark Extract. To Use: Apply Acne Treatment Serum to cleansed and toned skin and follow with Nature Pure moisturizer and sunscreen. Use once a day. For acne, oily and combination skin.

  "B0767FXN9B": "Flavo-C forte contains 15% L-ascorbic acid (the highest concentration of stabilised vitamin C) for optimal repairing. Thanks to its unique penetration system, Flavo-C forte acts effectively, rapidly and lastingly on restoring the relief of the skin. It is the ideal treatment for the areas of the face where the damage caused by time seem irreparable (frown lines, crow’s feet, lip contours, etc.). It can be used as a direct treatment in complement to Flavo-C serum in order to boost its action. Explanations: SKIN AGEING Over time the skin loses its flexibility and its radiance. These phenomena can be due to external factors (sun exposure, pollution, smoking, etc.) and internal factors (age, etc.). These factors favour the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles which give a dull and aged aspect to the skin. Furthermore, the concentration of vitamin C in the skin falls with age and exposure to UV rays, which has the effect of reducing the synthesis of collagen. Collagen is a protein which confers a resistance to stretching on the tissues. To deal with this fall, the vitamin C concentration in the skin must be increased in order to maintain an optimal collagen level and to keep the skin young, soft and radiant. For all skin types. Apply a few drops of Flavo-C forte to the tips of the fingers, and then spread over the areas to be treated (face, eye contours, neckline), morning and evening, paying particular attention to the areas most affected by time (lip contours, crow’s feet, frown lines). In the event of use of Flavo-C forte as “booster” for Flavo-C serum, two to three applications per week will suffice. Avoid contact with the eyes.",
